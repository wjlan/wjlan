Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Wanjun Lan.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently a software engineer student at Ada Developers Academy.
- ðŸ¤” Intrigued by travelling, photography, music, logic thinking, programming, fabulous food and even better conversations. Seeking to be inspired, to envision the unlikely, to work hard for things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by those who bring out the best in me.
